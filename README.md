# Let's learn the python for the control system design and analysis
These are my python scripts for control system design and analysis.
And also some Machine-Learning exercises are included.

## To see more details (I will write in the future)
My blog articles are available on Qiita (only in Japanese now).
I write the details of these codes there(*e.g.* mathematical backgrounds).

## Future objectives
I use sevaral programing language such as python, matlab, c++, java, ets..
So, I'll write codes by not only python but also other language.
